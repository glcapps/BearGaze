# BearGaze

**BearGaze** is a progressive image refinement system that upgrades placeholder PNGs by declaratively loading higher-resolution tiles based on metadata stored in a Parquet manifest.

## Key Features

- Begins with a fast-loading low-resolution PNG
- Enhances image progressively with higher-res tile overlays
- Uses a Parquet file to define tile positions, refinement levels, and algorithms
- Fully HTML-native — no canvas or custom pixel rendering required
- Powered by DuckDB-WASM for efficient in-browser querying via HTTP range requests

## Use Case

BearGaze is ideal for systems that require progressive visual clarity without waiting for large images to load — think documentation previews, high-res visual archives, or geospatial imagery.

## Project Status

Early prototype stage — core loading and refinement logic under active development.
